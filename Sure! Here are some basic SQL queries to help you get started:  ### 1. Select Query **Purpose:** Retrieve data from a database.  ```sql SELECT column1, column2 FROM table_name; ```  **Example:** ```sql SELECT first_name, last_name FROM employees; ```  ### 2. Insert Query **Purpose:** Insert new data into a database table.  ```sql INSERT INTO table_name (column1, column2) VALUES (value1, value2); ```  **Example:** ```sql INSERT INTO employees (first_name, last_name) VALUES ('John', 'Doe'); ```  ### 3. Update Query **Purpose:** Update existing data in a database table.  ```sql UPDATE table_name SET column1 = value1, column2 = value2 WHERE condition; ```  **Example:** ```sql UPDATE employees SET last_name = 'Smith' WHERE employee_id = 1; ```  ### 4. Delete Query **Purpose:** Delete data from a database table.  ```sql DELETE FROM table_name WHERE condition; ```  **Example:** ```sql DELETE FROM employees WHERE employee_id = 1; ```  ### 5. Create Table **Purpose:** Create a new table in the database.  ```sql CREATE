Sure! Here are some basic SQL queries to help you get started:

### 1. Select Query
**Purpose:** Retrieve data from a database.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name;
```

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees;
```

### 2. Insert Query
**Purpose:** Insert new data into a database table.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2)
VALUES (value1, value2);
```

**Example:**
```sql
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe');
```

### 3. Update Query
**Purpose:** Update existing data in a database table.

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;
```

**Example:**
```sql
UPDATE employees
SET last_name = 'Smith'
WHERE employee_id = 1;
```

### 4. Delete Query
**Purpose:** Delete data from a database table.

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Example:**
```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 1;
```

### 5. Create Table
**Purpose:** Create a new table in the database.

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);
```

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    hire_date DATE
);
```

### 6. Joins
**Purpose:** Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

**Inner Join Example:**
```sql
SELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

**Left Join Example:**
```sql
SELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```
